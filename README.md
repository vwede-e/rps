Finished with the first version of Odin Project's ROCK PAPER SCISSORS. 
This can only play in the console by invoking the playGame function;

The game continues to play until either the player or computer accumulates 5 points.

Added a basic GUI to the game. User can click different icons "rock" "paper" and "scissors" and play with the computer till either of them gets to 10.
